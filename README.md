### Bladder Closed Loop Optogenetic Control System
This repo is a modified version of Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Toolbox iOS app to interface the user for controlling the closed loop optogenetic control systems. 

### Device Firmware Update

The **Device Firmware Update (DFU)** profile allows you to update the application, bootloader and/or the Soft Device image over-the-air (OTA). It is compatible with Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822 devices that have the S110 SoftDevice and bootloader enabled. From version 1.5 onward, the nRF Toolbox has allowed to send the required init packet. More information about the init packet may be found here: [init packet handling](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-Master-Control-Panel/tree/master/init%20packet%20handling).

The DFU has the following features:
- Scans for devices that are in DFU mode.
- Connects to devices in DFU mode and uploads the selected firmware (soft device, bootloader and/or application).
- Allows HEX or BIN file upload through your phone or tablet.
- Allows to update a soft device and bootloader from ZIP in one connection.
- Pause, resume, and cancel file uploads.
- Includes pre-installed examples that consist of the Bluetooth Smart heart rate service and running speed and cadence service.
